# NYC_PA_Feb_2019
These are the unofficial election night results of the special election for New York City Public Advocate on February 26, 2019. These data were scraped from the [NYC Board of Elections website](https://web.enrboenyc.us/index.html).

The dataset is structured "long": one record is one candidate's vote count in one election district. Records contain identifying borough/county and assembly district for easy aggregation.

I am open to pull requests to fix bugs in or improve the Python processing script.
